# Etch-A-Sketch
The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate DOM manipulation skills by making a digital Etch-A-Sketch board.

1.Input is set by the user in 2 text boxes, 1 for the height and 1 for the width. Also has 1 button to resset the grid with set sizes.
(Grid has to be responsive, more squares means more detail in the board, as they will become smaller).

2.Input is got by the script and sees if it is a number
and if that number is more than 0 and less or equal to 100.

3.When the button is pressed the grid is generated and all square colors are reset.

4.When the mouse hovers over a square, that square changes to a random color.

5.every square touched is an interaction, and for every interaction all squares not currently black turn 10% more darker.
